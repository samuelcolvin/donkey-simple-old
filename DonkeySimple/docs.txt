Donkey Simple
=============

Donkey Simple is an extremely simple CMS that allows you to build a static website either from a web interface or the command line.

It uses clever tools like http://ace.c9.io/, http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ and http://jinja.pocoo.org/ to make writing the site as painless as possible.

Once you've written your site, it is generated **ONCE** and then saved as static files, meaning the site is **FAST**, **REALLY FAST** in a way dynamic sites build from templates using lots of database calls and slow interpretted languages so rarely are.
